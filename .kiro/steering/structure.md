## Source Organization
- `src/` - Main application source code
- `tests/` - Unit tests, integration tests, and test utilities
- `docs/` - Project documentation and guides

## File Naming Conventions
- Use consistent naming patterns based on chosen language/framework
- Follow language-specific conventions (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate file purpose

## Directory Guidelines
- Keep related functionality grouped together
- Separate concerns into logical modules/packages
- Maintain clear boundaries between different layers of the application

## Configuration Files
- Keep configuration files at appropriate levels (root, module-specific)
- Use environment-specific configurations when needed
- Document configuration options and their purposes
