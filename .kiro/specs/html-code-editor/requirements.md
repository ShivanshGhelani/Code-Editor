# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a web-based HTML code editor with live preview functionality, CSS framework switching capabilities, and page layout management. The editor provides a split-panel interface where users can write HTML code on one side and see the rendered output on the other, with options to switch between different CSS frameworks and page orientations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to write HTML code in a dedicated editor panel, so that I can create web content with syntax highlighting and proper formatting.

2. WHEN a user types in the code editor THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for HTML
3. WHEN a user writes HTML code THEN the system SHALL maintain proper indentation and formatting
4. WHEN the editor loads THEN the system SHALL include pre-written boilerplate HTML structure that cannot be edited
5. WHEN a user places the cursor in the editor THEN the system SHALL position it below the protected boilerplate code

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to see a live preview of my HTML code, so that I can immediately see how my changes affect the rendered output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user writes HTML code THEN the system SHALL render the preview in real-time
2. WHEN the preview panel is active THEN the system SHALL display the rendered HTML output
3. WHEN a user makes changes to the code THEN the system SHALL update the preview automatically

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to toggle between code editor and preview modes, so that I can focus on either writing code or reviewing the output.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a toggle button to switch between code editor and preview
2. WHEN a user clicks the toggle button THEN the system SHALL switch the main panel view between code editor and preview
3. WHEN the toggle button is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a beautiful, intuitive design
4. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL maintain the current code content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to open the preview in a new tab, so that I can view the rendered output in a separate window.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the preview toggle button is visible THEN the system SHALL display an "open in new tab" icon next to it
2. WHEN a user clicks the "open in new tab" icon THEN the system SHALL open the current preview in a new browser tab
3. WHEN opening in a new tab THEN the system SHALL render the same content as shown in the preview panel
4. WHEN the new tab opens THEN the system SHALL apply the currently selected CSS framework

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to switch between Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap frameworks, so that I can style my HTML with different CSS libraries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar loads THEN the system SHALL display a toggle option between Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap
2. WHEN a user selects Tailwind CSS THEN the system SHALL include Tailwind CSS CDN in the HTML boilerplate
3. WHEN a user selects Bootstrap THEN the system SHALL include Bootstrap CDN in the HTML boilerplate
4. WHEN switching frameworks THEN the system SHALL update the preview to reflect the new styling
5. WHEN the framework changes THEN the system SHALL update the protected boilerplate code accordingly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want to choose between portrait and landscape page orientations, so that I can design for different layout requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the sidebar loads THEN the system SHALL display a toggle option between portrait and landscape orientations
2. WHEN a user selects portrait orientation THEN the system SHALL apply A4 portrait page dimensions to the preview
3. WHEN a user selects landscape orientation THEN the system SHALL apply A4 landscape page dimensions to the preview
4. WHEN orientation changes THEN the system SHALL update the CSS boilerplate to reflect the new page size
5. WHEN orientation changes THEN the system SHALL update the preview layout immediately

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a sidebar with organized controls, so that I can easily access framework and orientation settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the system SHALL display a left sidebar with organized controls
2. WHEN the sidebar is visible THEN the system SHALL show the CSS framework toggle at the top
3. WHEN the sidebar is visible THEN the system SHALL show the orientation toggle below the framework toggle
4. WHEN controls are displayed THEN the system SHALL use clear labels and intuitive design
5. WHEN settings change THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback of the current selections

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want protected boilerplate code that adapts to my settings, so that I have a consistent starting point without accidentally breaking the structure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the editor loads THEN the system SHALL include HTML boilerplate with head section and basic structure
2. WHEN CSS framework is selected THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CDN links in the head section
3. WHEN page orientation is selected THEN the system SHALL include appropriate CSS for page dimensions
4. WHEN boilerplate code is displayed THEN the system SHALL prevent users from editing these protected lines
5. WHEN boilerplate updates due to setting changes THEN the system SHALL preserve user-written content below the protected area
